Iâ€™m a Jaguar enthusiast with a particular interest in preserving and modifying the XK8/XKR cars (X100 model).

Recent projects have included:

* Enabling axle ratio changes by modifying canbus wheel speed messages between the TCM and ECU, using Arduino based module
* Analyzing the AJ27 ECU firmware using Ghidra:
  * Ghidra loader for IDS AJ27 firmware files
  * Ghidra processor module for 68HC16
  * Ghidra analyzers to find tables and perform stack analysis
  * Ghidra scripts to assist in markup
* Motorola BDM application for flash code and configuration data extraction, using Arduino based module
* Writing a benchtop application for AJ27 ECU:
  * flash code extraction
  * reflashing
  * eprom persistent data extraction and overwrite (VIN, etc.)
